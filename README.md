### Description
Our game OctoDash is based on the highly versatile sea creature, the octopus. With its ability
to change its appearance color- and form-wise, shoot ink, and the fact that it possesses eight
tentacles, it offers itself as an ideal candidate to design a game around its capabilities while
ensuring sea-thematic setting.

OctoDash is a challenging 2D, two player, co-op game with its main gameplay revolving around
the cooperative steering of physically simulated tentacles. By means of cooperation, i.e. jointly
and strategically performing certain actions with the tentacles, two players must maneuver
themselves through the depths of the sea as quickly as possible in order to reach their feast
before starving to death.

With this silly-looking, quirky and maybe even sometimes frustrating movement, OctoDash
offers a challenging but enjoyable gameplay to both, casual and skilled, players.

In order to increase variety within the gameplay, players can collect and utilize power-ups,
interact with the environment to overcome obstacles, and race through different sea-themed
settings such as the deep sea, a fishing ship, or a sushi restaurant.

The optimal way to play OctoDash is together with a friend.
